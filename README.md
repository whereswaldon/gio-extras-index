# gio-extras

This is a collection of libraries to extend [gioui.org](https://gioui.org) with additional cross-platform features.

These additional features include:

- [material design components](https://git.sr.ht/~whereswaldon/materials)
- [scroll bars](https://git.sr.ht/~whereswaldon/scroll)
- [sending notifications from the background](https://git.sr.ht/~whereswaldon/niotify)
- [haptic feedback on mobile devices](https://git.sr.ht/~whereswaldon/haptic)
- [colorpickers](https://git.sr.ht/~whereswaldon/colorpicker)

## Licensing

All of these repositories are under the dual MIT/Unlicense to match Gio's own license. This makes it easy to combine them with Gio, and makes it possible for them to be merged into Gio in the future if ~eliasnaur chooses.

## Sponsorship
